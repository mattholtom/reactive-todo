== README

This is just an app I made while learning React and the Flux approach to front-end architecture. I used Rails as the API.

The interesting parts are in app/assets/javascripts, but also see app/views/tasks and app/controllers/tasks_controller.rb

This is probably out of date by now and React has moved quite far, so don't use it for a template or anything!
